      <h1><b><u>What we do...</u></b></h1>
      <p>We are Fast and Efficient or F.A.E for short. We aim
        for effiency and speed over all else, as you could already tell from the name.
        Our balance of these two concepts plus our exceptional quality when it comes to a mailing
        service allow us to stay on top of the game, ensuring you and your packages end up in the right hands,
        in record speed. 
      </p>
      <h3><u>Our Motto: Fast and Efficient!</u></h3>
      <h3><b><u>Our History:</u></b></h3>
      <p>Fast and Efficient, or F.A.E for short started when a few students complained about manual delivery and
        how <b>stressful</b> it was for deliverers to make fast and efficient deliveries
        several times a day. We were able to develop a propietary algorithm that cut down
        on any wasted time for deliveries and got packages out to people as soon as possible.
        The problem was <u>humans</u> could not fill the parameters for the algorithm. Our team 
        managed to cooperate with several robotics companies around the world to build a propietary drone
        to go along with our specific algorithm. Our service, <i><b>Dronelivery</b></i> is our flagship,
        allowing us to get packages to the people as soon as robotically possible.
      </p>
   <h3><b>Dronelivery:</b></h3>
   <p>
     <b>Dronelivery</b> allows us to stay ahead of the competition and offer Fast and Efficient services.
     We are partenered with many stores worldwide, as well as do some outsourcing for Amazon. Time and time again,
     our algorithm paired with our drones allow us to beat out our competition, and provide you with the best delivery service
     you could ask for.
