                    <h3>Our manufacturer</h3>
                    <big> Our drones are made by Flyability. They are a very passionate swiss company specialized in making drones. Despite its very young age, Flyability provides very distinct drone design which may help in various domains. We have exported more than 500 drones for initial testing and since then more than 2000 have been imported as we were very impressed and very probably more to come in future years.

                    <h3>Our Technology</h3>
                    <big>Our drones are modified so that every package arrives safely to the customer. 
                        We added an advanced safety system for extra protection. This insures that for 90% of the cases, the packages don't suffer almost any damages. 
                        For small packages, we modified the drones so that it gains more speed and faster delivery.

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <big>
                        We tested our drones in multiple locations and different countries. 
                        Our drones perform extremely well under rain, light wind and even snow. 
                        With our vey careful packaging, we make sure that it stays intact no matter what the weather is.
                         In case of locations or times with hot weather, we equip our drones with internal coolers that would make sure the engine and the package don't heat up.

                    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
                    <big>
                        Our drones are taken care of by the very best technicians in the field. 
                        Every single drone has a fast examination after each delivery, and a detailed examination at the end of each week. 
                        And to ensure that we always stay in touch with the latest technologies, the drones' software is updated every month, as we try to enhance their navigation and apply the latest Artificial Intelligence techniques.
