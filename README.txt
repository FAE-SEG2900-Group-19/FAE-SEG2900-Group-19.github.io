To do list:
- CSS: (Connor, Amalia, Lolita)
 Agree on a general style - implement in style.css and link style.css to all the HTML files in the <head> tag for each file
 IMPORTANT: MAKE DIVS/SPANS ASAP  - decide how we want to seperate pieces of each page (consistent)
 : make nav bar
 :fixed nav bar on screen, no matter where you scroll
 :logo/banner on top of nav bar
 
- Commit all HTML files to main branch

- JS: (Pradyu, Ramon, Omar)
: Location.html, mouseover see location info
: form validation index.html?
: pricing order button
